<p dir="ltr">Drēmboard is the ultimate photo and video management service that allows users to express their ideas and inspirations. It was founded on January 28, 2014 by Raymond Freeman III and Reco L. Dixon with the hope to encourage users to follow their drēm.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Our users are called “drēmers,” and they can post up pictures called “drēms,” or broadcast videos in our video section called “drēmcast.” Drēms can be organized into drēmboards where hopefully you’ll find your true passion and purpose.</p>
<p dir="ltr">No matter what the interest, if you’re a drēmer then you have discovered a place to share, create, and gather inspiration.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><i><b>Drēm it, Believe it, Achieve it.</b></i></p>
<p dir="ltr">We welcome your feedback. Email us anytime at customerservice@dremboard.com.</p>
